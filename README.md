### About

The Days Of Christmas is a HTML5/WebGL game written in Haxe, and was made in 18 hours for Ludum Dare 34.

The theme was growth or two-button gameplay. I originally planned to grow a Christmas tree out of text, but fell back to selecting text when I realized there wasn't time for that. It's unfinished. The lyrics of the main verse "grow", and at time of writing there are 12 days to Christmas.

The gameplay amounts to clicking colored text, with more time it could have been more interesting.
